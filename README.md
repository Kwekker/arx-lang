# The Arx language

This extension provides very simple syntax highlighting for the Arx language, used exclusively for the IDSP course at the University of Twente. I could not *stand* the colourless code (much less read it), so I decided to make this.

Information about the Arx language can be found [here](https://bibix.nl/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=arx:main). Thank you Sabih for the great courses :)

Might make a language server for it one day out of boredom lmao.

The json file is very unorganised and ugly, since I didn't have much time during the assignment to work on this, and cannot be bothered anymore now.
